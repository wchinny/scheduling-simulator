# scheduling-simulator
* a small, relatively thread-unsafe scheduling simulator that simulates some number of rovers and some number of charging stations for some statistics and for observation. meant to be a part of a larger, yet-to-be-released project.
* currently rather useless without conjunction with the said larger, yet-to-be-released project. but feel free to look at it and play with it in its current state.
